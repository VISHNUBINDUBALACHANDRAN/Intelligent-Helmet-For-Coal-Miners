# Intelligent-Helmet-For-Coal-Miners
This project aims to address the issue of coal mine accidents, which claim the lives of many people each year. According to studies, the rate of deaths in the coal mining sector is about six times that of all private industry. Poisonous gases, flames, and a lack of a rescue method are responsible for the bulk of these disasters.This degree of mortality may be significantly decreased by deploying a Coal Mine Surveillance robot, which can roam about autonomously in the mine and monitor the level of various poisonous chemicals and temperature levels and report them live to the control centre. It is the goal of this project to complete this assignment.This project is software and hardware focused from a technological standpoint. It necessitates extremely specialised sorts of sensors as well as novel data transmission and reception technologies. Because a traditional approach will not be very useful from an industrial standpoint, the project will be considered valid if it can detect various gases, temperature, and issue a warning to the miners inside the mine in the event of a danger, while simultaneously transmitting all data to the control panel. Setting up and offering tactics to a rescue team for rescue may make a big impact, and sending data to the control panel can help them save a lot of time.
